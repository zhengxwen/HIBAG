Description: It is a software package for imputing HLA types using SNP data,
    and relies on a training set of HLA and SNP genotypes. HIBAG can be used
    by researchers with published parameter estimates instead of requiring
    access to large training sample datasets. It combines the concepts of
    attribute bagging, an ensemble classifier method, with haplotype inference
    for SNPs and HLA types. Attribute bagging is a technique which improves
    the accuracy and stability of classifier ensembles using bootstrap
    aggregating and random variable selection.
